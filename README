Test User Utility for Facebook

This is a little utility that helps create test users for facebook applications.   You can
also make test users friends with one another, delete them and log them in.  See

http://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/

To make this work we need to supply a config.php file with your Facebook application
ID and secret defined in it.  

You will need to put the domain for your Facebook application in /etc/hosts unless you are hosting
these pages on a machine with the domain name of your facebook application.

Set up your php app in a path  /fb so your requests should look like so:

http://myfacebookappdomain.com/fb/list-test-users.php
